This is the Marine Hydrokinetic Data Repository (MHKDR) upload for the MASK4 test campaign.
Directory structure is as follows:

Top (this) level:
1) MASK4_testlog.xlsx: the test log from the test campaign on the "TestLog" sheet,
	and a second "Description" sheet explaining the test log layout
2) ./MHKDRCode: a selection of MATLAB processing codes
3) MHKDRDataUpload.zip: a compressed folder containing all significant processed
	data files, corresponding to the Filename column of the test log (these are time-
	stamped Mountain time). A suffix "full" indicates a wave run which will include
	wave basin wave data. A suffix "sys" indicates that it is not a wave run and 
	contains only waveBot system data. THIS IS AVAILALBE AT $$$$MHKDRLINK$$$$$
	and must be unzipped and placed in an accessible directory. Codes use explicit
	path names that will need to be modified to correspond to this directory

./MHKDRCode: Brief description of each code here, see header comments in the file
1) ./waveCalibration: for the excitation system identification performed in 
	calcExcitationv3, wave calibration data containing wave elevations at waveBot
	deployment location. These three *twe files contain this calibration data, and  
	are read by	importNSWCCD.m 
2) ./Z20A: contains *mat files of identified impedance models for the 20 amp case
	(Z...12.mat) with a magnetic spring rate of -9228 N/m, and the boundary element
	method data for the waveBot (WEC_T3R2.mat). These are generated by 
	msSysIdentification1x1_heave.m, but are provided for convenience. 
3) ampSpectra: a function to calculated a single-sided amplitude spectrum from input
	time series.
4) calcExcitationv3: performs system identification of the wave excitation model.
	Requires impedance models from ./Z20A and ./waveCalibration data.
5) gridTestVars: a helper function called by makeSurfacePlots.m 
6) importNSWCCD: a function to load wave calibration data ONLY. DO NOT USE 
	this function to load other wave data from the MASK4 test campaign (where
	wave data exists, it has already been merged into the provided data structure).
7) magSpringMapping: generates plots from the magnetic spring characterization.
8) makePowerSurfaces: makes power performance surfaces, set up for irregular waves
	with the standard drive.
9) makePowerSurfaces_CD3: a version of makePowerSurfacesv3, makes bar plots for 
	custom drive runs. 
10) makePowerSurfacesv2: similar to makePowerSurfacesv3, makes surface and scatter
	plots for wave cases with standard drive.
11) makePowerSurfacesv3: makes surface and scatter plots for wave cases with 
	standard drive.
12) msSysIdentification1x1_heave: identifies various admittance models from the 
	no wave multisine runs.
13) msSysIdentification1x1_heaveCD: identifies various admittance models from the 
	no wave multisine runs with the custom drive.
14) tweMerge: function merges the wave basin data structure with the waveBot data 
	structure. 
15) tweRead: function reads wave basin data and creates wave basin data structure.
16) tweSync: function synchronizes wave basin data with waveBot data (see report).

NOTE: no need to run twe* functions, this was already done for all *full.mat data
structures, these functions are included for completeness.
