# fbWecCntrl

**NOTE: this code is fully-functional, but not supported and users should not expect responses to issues**

fbWecCntrl is a set of MATLAB functions and scripts demonstrating a causal impedance matching approach to wave energy converter (WEC) control design.
The methods applied in this code are detailed in a journal paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2021.110791), and are a fork of code originally published on [MHK-DR](https://mhkdr.openei.org/submissions/315).

1. **Download the fbWecCntrl software**: Clone the repository or download an archive. If required, unzip the archive to a path of your choosing.

2. **Add fbWecCntrl to your MATLAB path**: Add the necessary directories to your MATLAB path using the MATLAB command prompt.

    ```matlab
    >> addpath(genpath('/path/to/fbWecCntrl'));
    >> savepath;
   ```

3. **Run the demo cases**: Run the demo cases for the WaveBot and FOSWEC.

    ```matlab
    >> demo_waveBot
    >> demo_foswec
   ```
